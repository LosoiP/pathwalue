<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>
Search for pathways by specifying which compounds and enzymes must be present.
A search is valid if you enter either at least 2 compounds or at least 1 enzyme in the corresponding fields.
The application returns only such pathways that include all the given compounds and enzymes.
</p>
<p>
To perform a directed search from a source compound to a target compound, enter at least 2 compounds.
The leftmost compound is treated as the source and the righmost compound as the target.
You may use the wildcard compound "any ChEBI" if you don't wish to specify either the source or the target compound.
</p>
<p>
Searching with only enzymes performs a search to and from the reactions that are catalyzed by the given enzymes.
</p>

<h3>Search parameter examples</h3>
<p>
Compounds: "Any ChEBI", "15361 pyruvate" and "36208 shikimate".
<br />
Returns pathways that have 36208 shikimate as target and involve also 15361 pyruvate at some reaction step.
</p>
<p>
Compounds: "4167 D-glucopyranose" and "16236 ethanol", enzymes: "1.1.1.1 Alcohol dehydrogenase".
<br />
Returns pathways that start from 4167 D-glucopyranose, end in 16236 ethanol and have 1.1.1.1 Alcohol dehydrogenase as a catalyst.
</p>
<p>
Enzymes: "1.2.1.10 Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (acetylating)" and "4.1.1.4 Acetoacetate decarboxylase".
<br />
Returns pathways that involve both 1.2.1.10 Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (acetylating) and 4.1.14 Acetoacetate decarboxylase as catalysts.
</p>
<h3>Filtering results (advanced)</h3>
<p>
The pathways generated by PathWalue may contain undesirable or unrealistic reaction connections due to an unambigous biological role of certain metabolites.
The issue can arise when a metabolite is a cofactor in some reactions but the main substrate or product in other reactions.
In these situations you may refine your search by adding a link filter in the Filter linking compounds field at the Input section and then submitting the search again.
Filtering a linking compound means that the compound cannot be the only link between any two successive reactions.
</p>
<p>
Example: searching pathways from "29991 L-aspartate(1-)" to "17602 4-aminophenol" generated a pathway where reaction Rhea:12382 is linked to Rhea:16507.
The products of Rhea:12382 are "L-2,4-diazaniumylbutyrate" and "15361 pyruvate", and the substrates of Rhea:16507 are "15361 pyruvate" and "17879 4-hydroxybenzoate".
Here pyruvate, that plays several biological roles, has connected the two reactions in an unrealistic way.
Filtering "15361 pyruvate" would block this pathway since it involves such a reaction pair, where pyruvate is the only link.
</p>
<p>
More filtering options may be added in future.

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
The PathWalue application is intended to find biochemical pathways that have commercial potential.
The commercial potential of a pathway is estimated by the value of the compounds involved in the pathway and the complexity of the reaction steps needed.
The price and demand data of compounds and complexity data of reactions are synthetic in the test version and they aren't necessarily realistic.
</p>
<p>
A pathway is considered to have a good commercial potential if its reaction steps are not too complex to implement and its products are more valuable than its substrates.
</p>
<p>
PathWalue is meant to serve as a tool in preliminary analysis of the profitability of biochemical pathways.
