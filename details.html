<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
The PathWalue application is intended to find biochemical pathways that have commercial potential.
The commercial potential of a pathway is estimated by the value of the compounds involved in the pathway and the complexity of the reaction steps needed.
The price and demand data of compounds and complexity data of reactions are synthetic in the test version and they aren't necessarily realistic.
</p>
<p>
A pathway is considered to have a good commercial potential if its reaction steps are not too complex to implement and its products are more valuable than its substrates.
</p>
<p>
PathWalue is meant to serve as a tool in preliminary analysis of the profitability of biochemical pathways.

<h1>PathWalue - pathways with value</h1>
<p>
Welcome to read a more detailed description of the PathWalue application!
</p>
<p>
The processing of user input in PathWalue can be divided to five distinct steps:
<ol>
<li>Determination of the search type.</li>
<li>Generating pathways.</li>
<li>Filtering pathways.</li>
<li>Evaluating pathways.</li>
<li>Formatting results.</li>
</ol>
</p>



<hr class="sectionLine" />

<h3>1. Determination of the search type.</h3>
<p>
PathWalue first determines what kind of a search it is conducting: a directed search from or to a compound or an undirected search of enzyme-catalyzed reactions.
The decision is based on user input in the Compound and Enzymes fields in the Input-section.
</p>
<h4>Directed search</h4>
<p>
If the user has specified more than one compound, the search is always conducted from the first compound to the last compound.
PathWalue uses as source reactions all those reactions that have the first compound as a substrate.
Likewise PathWalue considers all reactions producing the last compound as target reactions.
The search is then conducted using source-target -pairs of reactions.
</p>
<p>
A wildcard compound "any ChEBI" can be used to leave either the source or target compound open.
If "any ChEBI" is the source, then PathWalue generates pathways from all reactions to those reactions that produce the given target compound.
</p>
<p>
Examples:
<ul>
<li>Searching with compounds "57629 D-glucopyranose 1-phosphate(2-)", "15589 (S)-malate(2-)", "16630 3-dehydroshikimate" generates pathways that start from a reaction consuming "57629 D-glucopyranose 1-phosphate(2-)" and end in a reaction producing "16630 3-dehydroshikimate". All the generated pathways involve "15589 (S)-malate(2-) at some reaction step."</li>
<li>Searching with compounds "29985 L-glutamate(1-)", "57305 glycine zwitterion" and "any ChEBI" generates pathways that start in a reaction that consumes "29985 L-glutamate(1-)" and end in any reaction. All the generated pathways involve "57305 glycine zwitterion" at some reaction step.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h4>Undirected search</h4>
<p>
If the user hasn't specified enough compounds to conduct a directed search, PathWalue collects all reactions that the given enzymes are involved in.
The collected reactions are then used as sources and targets to yield pathways.
</p>
<p>
Examples:
<ul>
<li>Searching with the enzymes "1.14.13.118 Valine N-monooxygenase" and "1.14.11.45 L-isoleucine 4-hydroxylase" generates pathways that start in a reaction catalyzed by either of the enzymes and end in a reaction catalyzed by either of the enzymes.</li>
<li>Searching with the enzyme "4.1.2.41 Vanillin synthase" and compound "30089 acetate" generates pathways that start or end in a reaction catalyzed by "4.1.2.41 Vanillin synthase" and also involve "30089 acetate" at some reaction step.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>2. Generating pathways.</h3>
<p>
PathWalue generates pathways using a shortest path algorithm to a directed graph representation of Rhea reactions.
</p>
<h4>Directed graph</h4>
<p>
Generating pathways in PathWalue is based on a directed graph of nodes that correspond to reactions in the Rhea database.
Every reaction exists in both directions in the graph.
</p>
<p>
Any two reaction nodes are connected by an edge if the first reaction produces a substrate for the second reaction.
Reactions are not connected to their opposite direction reactions though as that would result in unrealistic short circuiting.
Connections based on certain compounds such as water are forbidden and not present in the graph.
At the moment PathWalue has a predefined list of 500 compounds that are not allowed to link to successive reactions.
</p>
<p>
The reaction graph in PathWalue has about 14500 nodes and 230000 edges.
</p>
<h4>Search algorithm</h4>
<p>
The algorithm looks for the shortest paths from the source to target reaction.
Moving from one reaction node to another occurs always trough a directed edge.
Recall from the Directed graph -section that a reaction has an edge to another reaction if it produces a substrate for the other reaction.
</p>
<p>
At the moment the edges are unweighted which means that all edges are equal in length.
</p>

<h3>3. Filtering pathways.</h3>
<p>
PathWalue filters all generated pathways according to these criteria:
<ul>
<li>All the given compounds must be present in the pathway</li>
<li>All the given enzymes must be present in the pathway</li>
<li>Successive producing and consuming of a compound in three successive reactions is forbidden. Example: a pathway is filterd away if its reaction 1 produces A, reaction 2 consumes A and reaction 3 produces A again.</li>
</ul>
PathWalue uses additionally these criteria when a directed search is conducted from or to a compound:
<ul>
<li>The specified source compound must not be produced by any of the pathway's reactions</li>
<li>The specified target compound must not be consumed by any of the pathway's reactions</li>
</ul>
<p>
Only such pathways that fulfill the necessary criteria will be evaluated.
</p>



<hr class="sectionLine" />

<h3>4. Evaluating pathways.</h3>
<p>
PathWalue scores pathways according to the values of the compounds and
complexities of the reaction steps.
</p>
<p>
Compound values are based on a synthetic database of market demands and prices.
The value of a compound is evaluated as a product of its demand and price.
</p>
<p>
Reaction complexities are based on the amount and types of biochemically
important cofactors involved in the reaction step.
PathWalue considers reactions involving cofactors less complex than those that
don't involve.
</p>
<p>
A pathway's score is evaluated as the ratio of the total value of compounds to the total complexity and amount of reaction steps.
</p>



<hr class="sectionLine" />

<h3>5. Formatting results.</h3>
<p>
PathWalue returns the best scoring pathways and shows additional details of it.
The output is divided into the pathway's total reaction, score, substrates, intermediates, products and reaction steps.
<ul>
<li>Total reaction: pathway substrates => pathway products</li>
<li>Score: pathway's total score evaluated as described in section 4. Evaluating pathways</li>
<li>Substrates: a list of those compounds that are used only as substrates in the pathways reaction steps</li>
<li>Intermediates: a list of those compounds that are consumed by a reaction but also produced by some other reaction</li>
<li>Products: a list of those compounds that are only produced in the reaction steps.</li>
<li>Reaction steps: a list of individual Rhea reactions that constitute the pathway. Each reaction step has a list of its substrates, products and also possible enzyme catalysts if applicable.</li>
</ul>
