<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
The PathWalue application is intended to find biochemical pathways that have commercial potential.
The commercial potential of a pathway is estimated by the value of the compounds involved in the pathway and the complexity of the reaction steps needed.
The price and demand data of compounds and complexity data of reactions are synthetic in the test version and they aren't necessarily realistic.
</p>
<p>
A pathway is considered to have a good commercial potential if its reaction steps are not too complex to implement and its products are more valuable than its substrates.
</p>
<p>
PathWalue is meant to serve as a tool in preliminary searching of potentially profitable biochemical pathways.
Thus the results aren't necessarily realistic and directly applicable, but need to be interpreted.

<h1>PathWalue - pathways with value</h1>
<p>
Welcome to read the description of the PathWalue application!
</p>
<hr class="sectionLine" />
<h2>Details of user input processing</h2>
<p>
The processing of user input in PathWalue can be divided to five distinct steps:
<ol>
<li>Determination of the search type</li>
<li>Generating pathways</li>
<li>Filtering pathways</li>
<li>Evaluating pathways</li>
<li>Formatting results.</li>
</ol>
</p>



<hr class="sectionLine" />

<h3>1 Determination of the search type</h3>
<p>
PathWalue first determines what kind of a search it is conducting: a directed search from or to a compound or an undirected search of enzyme-catalyzed reactions.
The decision is based on user input in the Compound and Enzymes fields in the Input-section.
</p>
<h4>Directed search</h4>
<p>
If the user has specified more than one compound, the search is always conducted from the first compound to the last compound.
PathWalue uses as source reactions all those reactions that have the first compound as a substrate.
Likewise PathWalue considers all reactions producing the last compound as target reactions.
The search is then conducted using source-target -pairs of reactions.
</p>
<p>
A wildcard compound "any ChEBI" can be used to leave either the source or target compound open.
If "any ChEBI" is the source, then PathWalue generates pathways from all reactions to those reactions that produce the given target compound.
This may result in a slow search.
The search comprehensity of "any ChEBI" will be restricted in a future update to make computational time feasible.
</p>
<p>
Examples:
<ul>
<li>Searching with compounds "57629 D-glucopyranose 1-phosphate(2-)", "15589 (S)-malate(2-)", "16630 3-dehydroshikimate" generates pathways that start from a reaction consuming "57629 D-glucopyranose 1-phosphate(2-)" and end in a reaction producing "16630 3-dehydroshikimate". All the generated pathways involve "15589 (S)-malate(2-) at some reaction step."</li>
<li>Searching with compounds "29985 L-glutamate(1-)", "57305 glycine zwitterion" and "any ChEBI" generates pathways that start in a reaction that consumes "29985 L-glutamate(1-)" and end in any reaction. All the generated pathways involve "57305 glycine zwitterion" at some reaction step.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h4>Undirected search</h4>
<p>
If the user hasn't specified enough compounds to conduct a directed search, PathWalue collects all reactions that the given enzymes are involved in.
The collected reactions are then used as sources and targets to yield pathways.
If only 1 enzyme is present, PathWalue uses all possible reactions as additional sources and targets, which may result in a slow search.
The search comprehensity of using only 1 enzyme will be restricted in a future update to make computational time feasible.
</p>
<p>
Examples:
<ul>
<li>Searching with the enzymes "1.14.13.118 Valine N-monooxygenase" and "1.14.11.45 L-isoleucine 4-hydroxylase" generates pathways that start in a reaction catalyzed by either of the enzymes and end in a reaction catalyzed by either of the enzymes.</li>
<li>Searching with the enzyme "4.1.2.41 Vanillin synthase" and compound "30089 acetate" generates pathways that start or end in a reaction catalyzed by "4.1.2.41 Vanillin synthase" and also involve "30089 acetate" at some reaction step.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>2 Generating pathways</h3>
<p>
PathWalue generates pathways using a shortest path algorithm to a directed graph representation of Rhea reactions.
</p>
<h4>Directed graph</h4>
<p>
Generating pathways in PathWalue is based on a directed graph of nodes that correspond to reactions in the Rhea database.
Every reaction exists in both directions in the graph as separate nodes, just as the different directions exist in separate entries in the Rhea database.
</p>
<p>
Any two reaction nodes are connected by an edge if the first reaction produces a substrate for the second reaction.
Reactions are not connected to their opposite direction reactions though, as that would result in unrealistic short circuiting.
Connections based on certain compounds such as water are forbidden and not present in the graph.
At the moment PathWalue has a predefined list of 500 compounds that are not allowed to link to successive reactions.
The list inclues inorganic ions, cofactors and protein residues among others.
</p>
<p>
The reaction graph in PathWalue has about 14500 nodes and 230000 edges.
</p>
<h4>Search algorithm</h4>
<p>
The algorithm looks for the shortest paths from the source to target reaction.
The source and target reactions are determined as described in section 1 Determination of the search type.
Moving from one reaction node to another occurs always trough a directed edge.
Recall from the Directed graph section that a reaction has an edge to another reaction if it produces a substrate for the other reaction.
</p>
<p>
At the moment the edges are unweighted which means that all edges are equal in length.
</p>



<hr class="sectionLine" />

<h3>3 Filtering pathways</h3>
<p>
PathWalue filters all generated pathways according to these criteria:
<ul>
<li>All the given compounds in the Compounds field at the Input section must be present in the pathway.</li>
<li>All the given enzymes in the Enzymes field at the Input section must be present in the pathway.</li>
<li>Repetitive producing and consuming of a compound in three successive reactions is forbidden.
    <br />Example: a pathway is filtered if its reaction 1 produces compound A, reaction 2 consumes A and reaction 3 produces A again.</li>
</ul>
PathWalue uses additionally these criteria when a directed search is conducted from or to a compound:
<ul>
<li>The specified source compound must not be produced by any of the pathway's reactions.</li>
<li>The specified target compound must not be consumed by any of the pathway's reactions.</li>
</ul>
If the user has specified link filters then the following criterion is also used:
<ul>
<li>A compound in the Filter linking compounds field at the Input section must not be the only connection from one reaction to another.</li>
</ul>
Only such pathways that fulfill the necessary criteria will be evaluated.
</p>



<hr class="sectionLine" />

<h3>4 Evaluating pathways</h3>
<p>
PathWalue scores pathways according to the values of the compounds and
complexities of the reaction steps.
</p>
<p>
Compound values are based on a synthetic database of market demands and prices.
The value of a compound is evaluated as a product of its demand and price.
The synthetic database has been prepared by using ChEBI compound ontology that also includes classifications related to compound applications and functional groups.
</p>
<p>
Reaction complexities are based on the amount and types of biochemically
important cofactors involved in the reaction step.
PathWalue considers reactions involving cofactors less complex than those that
don't involve.
This mechanism favours pathways that involve biologically meaningful cofactors.
</p>
<p>
A pathway's score is evaluated as the ratio of the total value of compounds to the total complexity and amount of reaction steps.
</p>



<hr class="sectionLine" />

<h3>5 Formatting results</h3>
<p>
PathWalue returns the best scoring pathways and shows additional details of it.
The output is divided into the pathway's total reaction, score, substrates, intermediates, products and reaction steps.
<ul>
<li>Total reaction: pathway substrates => pathway products.
    <br />Pathway substrates and products are defined below.</li>
<li>Score: pathway's total score evaluated as described in section 4 Evaluating pathways</li>
<li>Substrates: a list of those compounds that are used only as substrates in the pathway's reaction steps</li>
<li>Intermediates: a list of those compounds that are consumed by a reaction but also produced by some other reaction.
    <br />Compounds classified here as intermediates contain all the links between successive reactions, but also all other such compounds that are both produced and consumed during the pathway.</li>
<li>Products: a list of those compounds that are only produced in the reaction steps</li>
<li>Reaction steps: a list of the individual Rhea reactions that constitute the pathway. Each reaction step has a list of its substrates, products and also possible enzyme catalysts if applicable.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>
PathWalue is implemented as a single page web application to enable an easy review of the idea, even though performance had to be partly compromised.
The application code is a set of JavaScript functions that read the input fields of the web page and process the input as described in Details of user input processing.
JavaScript was chosen for the application because it's executed reasonably well by major up-to-date web browsers.
</p>
<p>
The static data for PathWalue has been prepared with Python modules that read data from ChEBI, IntEnz and Rhea databases.
The relevant data are converted to JSON formatted files for the JavaScript functions to use.
</p>
<p>
The Python-generated static data in JSON files are used to construct the directed graph described in section 2 Generating pathways.
They are also used as the synthetic market database of compound prices and demands (section 4 Evaluating pathways).
</p>
<p>
The application has been tested using Firefox 45 and Internet Explorer 11 web browsers.
